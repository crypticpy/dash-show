## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (Immediate):**

- Interactive Learning Panel with viz principles
- Enhanced filtering and search
- Glossary and educational tooltips

**Phase 2 (Short-term):**

- Side-by-side comparison tool
- Pattern library and categorization
- Accessibility analysis features

**Phase 3 (Long-term):**

- Community annotation system
- Interactive canvas and drawing tools
- Presentation and teaching modes

## ðŸ’¡ Success Metrics

- Time spent on site (engagement)
- Return visits from educators
- Submissions from students
- Citations in academic papers
- Integration into curricula

This transforms it from a simple showcase into an interactive learning platform that teaches the "why" behind data visualization choices, not just the "what".
